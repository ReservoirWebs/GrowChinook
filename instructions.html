<h1>This site allows you to run the model in four modes:<br></h1>

<h3>The Standard Model - A single 30 day run<br></h3>
<p style="margin-left:5em;">First, enter a Starting Mass for your fish. Then select a Year, Site,
 and Month. These will be used to fill in Daphnia Density, Daphnia Size, Light Extinction
 Coefficient, Daphnia Distribution Curve, and Temperature Curve.<br>
 Clicking the "Apply Observed Values" button at this point will populate the Daphnia Density,
 Daphnia Size, Light Extinction Coefficient fields, although you can override these values by
 entering values into the "Using" fields.<br>
 If you would like to restrict either the temperatures or depths available to your fish, use the
 "Maximum Temperature", "Minimum Temperature", "Maximum Depth", and "Minimum Depth" fields
 Enter temperatures in degrees celsius, and depths in meters.<br>
 Be aware that restricting temperature or depth can lead to the fish having no available habitat.
 This kills the model.<br>
 Next, you may choose to override the observed Daphnia Distribution or Temperature curves
 with either our observed data from a different Year/Site/Month combination,
 by using the Daphnia and Temperature Year/Site/Month dropdowns, or by uploading custom
 curves using our temperature and daphnia csv templates.<br>
 Optionally, you can enter an elevation to be used to estimate, given the input parameters,
 the population at which density dependent interactions are expected.<br>
 Finally, enter a tab label to help keep track of your runs, and hit submit to run the model.<br>
 Here are the default values used if all fields are left blank:<br>
 - Starting Mass = 20<br>
 - Year = 2015<br>
 - Site = Fall Creek<br>
 - Month = June</p>

<h3>Model with Sensitivity - A set of standard runs over which a single input parameter is changed,
while the other input parameters remain fixed.<br></h3>
<p style="margin-left:5em;">First select the input parameter to run sensitivity analysis for,
and enter the range (in percentage change to original value) to scale the value up to.
This parameter will be entered into the model 20 times, nine times at values smaller than what
you enter into the corresponding form field, once at that value, and ten times at values larger
than the value entered on the form. For values smaller, your entered value will be divided by the
numbers 2-10. For values larger, the range you entered will be divided into ten steps, and your
value will be increased by one step each time, finally running at the percentage entered of the base value.<br>
From here, follow the instructions for the Standard Model.</p>

<h3>Advanced Sensitivity - Runs sensitivity analysis for every month for a given site and year<br></h3>
<p style="margin-left:5em;">For Advanced Sensitivity, start as you would for a Sensitivity run, by selecting the
 input parameter for which to run sensitivity analysis.<br>
For advanced Sensitivity, you will select only a Site and Year, and the model will run for each Month for which
background data corresponding to that Site and Year combination is available.<br>
Options for this mode are limited to selecting Starting Mass, Daphnia Size, Daphnia Abundance, and Light
 Extinction Coefficient. Leaving any of these fields blank will result in default values being used. For this run,
the option to restrict Depth and Temperature is also available.

<h3>Multiple Month Run - Runs consecutive 30 day runs to simulate a summer using observed data<br></h3>
<p style="margin-left:5em;">For this run, simply select a Year, Site, Month, Starting Month, and Ending Month.<br>
The model will run using observed data.
